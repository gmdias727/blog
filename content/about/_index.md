Hi, my name is Gabriel, I'm 25 years old, my day one in tech was in feb/2019 and to be fair I'm in a consistent pace since July/2024 only.

I'm 6'4 foot tall (1.93 meters), I have a small female cat called Canelinha (stands for "Little Shin or "Tiny Shin")

I am programmer/developer/software engineer/SWE with background in fullstack development designing databases, frontend and backend alongside
engineering team for shipping products

I'm aware/acknowledged about these niches:
- fidelity and customer experience 
- data analysis
- finance and banking

I didn't find a path I'm most interested in, but I'm aware that finding one is very important.

Why I'm just in a consistent pace now in 2025? for a couple of reasons, I stopped hopping from one programming language to another; I still cannot explain clearly why I've done that, and my most basic hypothesis is that I was hopping to understand more things, something like procedural, object oriented and functional programming; turns out none of these mattered and now I stick with Go and C only, doing OSSU computer science course.

Meanwhile I'm not doing that so much anymore, I still cope with social media doomscrolling sometimes.

Just letting you know, I'm a very caring person.
