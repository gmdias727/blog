# The Blog

This blog was build with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) using [apollo](https://www.getzola.org/themes/apollo/) theme from [not-matthias](https://github.com/not-matthias)

To be fair I was firstly inspired by [miguel-nascimento](https://github.com/miguel-nascimento) which is a person I once knew and have built his own blog with the same template [here](https://github.com/miguel-nascimento/my-blog) and [here](https://shiroikami.vercel.app/)

# Why this blog exists

I feel like I should build something sort of like a second brain, but also a place I could write about something I learned, my opinion on something that is happening at I don't know tech/AI/developers bubble at twitter, and also a place I could commit mistakes without too much worrying.

I think it's important to share this with another people and also at Linkedin so people will notice my efforts and commitment with my career or job or whatever I'm taking seriously at the moment.
