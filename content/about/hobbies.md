Currently learning chess as my first hobby, I'm not focusing on winning, just moving pieces correctly for fun, playing unrated matches and puzzles.

This year was entirely committed watching Dr.House (currently season 7) and playing league of legends once in a while (not anymore since I'm using NixOS now, best choice of my life to be fair)
