# Getting Started with Rust Programming

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory safety** without garbage collection
- **Zero-cost abstractions**
- **Fearless concurrency**
- **Cross-platform support**

## Installation

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This is just a sample post to demonstrate the `tech` tag functionality.
